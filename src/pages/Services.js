            <p>
                I am a certified <b>life and leadership coach</b> and I work with clients in a few different ways.</p><br />
            <p>In all my coaching work, I challenge clients to stretch their capacity by asking for far more than they
                have done before.</p><br /><p> I use a <b>non-judgemental approach</b> while being open and honest about what I hear and see.</p><br /><p>
                <b>Coaching </b>is confidential, developmental, safe and provokes the client into action.
                I am a warm and sincere coach and take pride in making sure my clients feel their goal has been achieved through coaching.
                I keep in touch with clients between sessions and continually improve my
                coaching skills through my own ongoing professional development.</p>
