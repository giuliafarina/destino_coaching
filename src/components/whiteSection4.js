                    <p>Designed to support new or promising teachers, who need that extra bit of support to secure great teaching, every day.
                        Nadia works alongside the teacher as an instructional coach.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The package includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three days direct work in school</li>
                        <li>Day meeting time with teacher and/or line manager</li>
                        <li> Written report and further recommendations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>We identify goals with the teacher and their line manager and then nadia observes,
                        team-teaches and uses role play and live feedback to coach the teacher through improving practice in the classroom.</p><br />

                    <p>Time can be allocated to planning and evaluation of impact in pupilsâ€™ work.</p><br />
                    <p>At the end of the school based work, we will provide a written report on what has been
                        covered, how the participant has improved and recommended next steps, including
                        research and reading suggestions.</p>
