                    <p>Since leaving headship, I have been coaching school leaders and providing support to  schools that want to develop coaching approaches. I also  work with Achievement For All, delivering their Achieving Schools and Achieving Wellbeing programmes, as well as Ambition School Leadership and Inspiration Trust, facilitating on their NPQs. I wholeheartedly believe coaching approaches will retain teachers, strengthen school leadership and serve our children and young people.
                        When I am not working, I enjoy walking, cycling (gently) and I have always found comfort in fabric and crafts (currently itâ€™s crochet).
