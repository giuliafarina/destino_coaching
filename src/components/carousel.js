                        There is certainly analysis on why such goals are set, but the secret weapon is making a plan, leaning onto action, making things real. 
                        I like to think of myself as a doer and you make me feel more and more like this, like itâ€™s learning a new way to live, more direct, more brave, 
                        where what I want happens, because I dedicated time to create a good, compassionate, clever strategy, that is fuelled by my values and respects and strengthens how I am.
You make me feel like the best version of myself." caption="Virginia - UX Designer " />
